# Landing page

I'm presenting you a landing page of a promotional Bike store web site.
It is developed using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) component-based approach and advanced scss styling capabilities.
The 'menu' icon in the top right corner of the page opens a pop-up navigation menu.
Main part of the page consists of four chapters, presesenting different types of the bikes.
There's a form in the bottom part of the page offering a customer to send his purchase request.
